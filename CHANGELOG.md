# Changelog

Notable changes to Sirat Path. Dates are deployment dates; each push to `main` deploys to production.

## 2026-10-10
### Added
- **Urdu hadith translations** with an English / اردو / Both switch for Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasaʾi, Ibn Majah and Muwatta. Included in offline downloads.
- Project documentation: PRD, SRS, design, data model, deployment, privacy policy, terms of use, security policy, test plan, project report, `CLAUDE.md`, license.
### Changed
- Content review: the Duas icon is now raised open palms (🤲) instead of folded "praying hands"; the Kids icon and the family emoji no longer show faces of people.
- 99 Names: paired names (e.g. Ad-Ḍārr with An-Nāfiʿ, Al-Muʿizz with Al-Mudhill) are shown together on the Home card, and flashcards note the pairing. Al-Majīd and Al-Mājid are now spelled distinctly.
### Fixed
- **Sunan an-Nasaʾi and Ibn Majah failed to load**, because jsDelivr returned 403 for that package. Hadith now fall back to the GitHub mirror.

## 2026-10-08
### Added
- English / Urdu / Both / Off translation switch in the Quran reader, with a choice of Urdu translator.
- Prominent green WhatsApp share buttons on ayahs, hadith, duas and Home. Bigger action icons.
- SEO: per-page titles and descriptions, Open Graph and Twitter previews, JSON-LD, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`.
- Install banner (Android prompt and iOS steps) with a share invitation.
- Vercel Web Analytics.
- Automatic cloud sync (start, focus, reconnect, periodic, after edits).
### Fixed
- Blank white screen after returning from WhatsApp. WhatsApp now opens directly through the app scheme instead of leaving a wa.me tab behind.
- Overflow of dua actions on narrow screens. Responsive fixes on prayer reminders, Qibla and Ask.
